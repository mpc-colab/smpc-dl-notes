Oftentimes, these systems will require the use of image segmentation and object recognition protocols. The images used for this task expose often-times sensitive data about individual users.\nIn the practical setting of interest, this means exposing license-plate information, associated vehicles, and location information available from the images themselves.\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nx + y &= 3 \\\\\n2x - y &= 1\n\\end{align}\n\\]"
