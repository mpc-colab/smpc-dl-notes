In order to export a matcha diagram, you need to enter the full-screen mode for the diagram, and click on the “export” drop-down which becomes available. This will allow you to save the math diagram as a png image. We will make liberal use of these throughout the book, especially for explaining complex security primitives such as beaver’s triples and homomorphic encryption."

    "text": "1.1 Motivation\nSecure Red Light Violation detection is an important application of secure machine learning protocols. Oftentimes, these systems will require the use of image segmentation and object recognition protocols. The images used for this task expose often-times sensitive data about individual users.\nIn the practical setting of interest, this means exposing license-plate information, associated vehicles, and location information available from the images themselves."

See the citation Dokur and Katkoori (2022)\n\n\n1.2.1 Red Light Violation Detection Algorithm\nThe proposed system utilizes the following logic to detect whether a car will violate a red light.  A car which is approaching an intersection is connected to road-side units (RSUs)  which are installed at traffic lights in an intersection.\nEach light is said to be located at points \\(B(x_{2}, y_{2}, z_{2})\\), \\(C(x_{3}, y_{3}, z_{3})\\), \\(D(x_{4}, y_{4}, z_{4})\\) and \\(E(x_{5}, y_{5}, z_{5})\\) respectively.\nUnlike image-based systems, this system  assumes V2I communication between the traffic lights and the vehicle in question.  This means that the traffic state does not need to be determined by an image classifier. Rather, we already have this information by default."

They aimed to model several time-dependencies: (1) recent, (2) daily-periodic, and (3) weekly-periodic dependencies.
