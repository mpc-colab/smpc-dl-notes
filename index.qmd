## Resources {.unnumbered}

The [matcha editor](https://www.mathcha.io/) is used to construct
some of the mathematical diagrams shown in this book. In order to 
export a matcha diagram, you need to enter the full-screen mode
for the diagram, and click on the "export" drop-down which becomes
available. This will allow you to save the math diagram as a png
image. We will make liberal use of these throughout the book, 
especially for explaining complex security primitives such as 
beaver's triples and homomorphic encryption.
