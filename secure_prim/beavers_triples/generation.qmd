## Generating Boolean Beaver's Triples

The first step in masking the AND operation is to generate Boolean Beaver's Triples. These are random bits $a$, $b$, and $c$ such that $c = a \cdot b$, where $\cdot$ represents the AND operation. Throughout this tutorial we define $a = a_A \oplus a_B$, $b = b_A \oplus b_B$, $c = c_A \oplus c_B$, and $r = r_A \oplus r_B$.

### Step 1: Generating Inputs

Suppose we have two parties, **Alice** and **Bob**. We begin by first generating a random pair $(a_{i}, b_{i})$ for each 
party where $i$ corresponds to the party in question. We generate 
these from the field $F_{2}^{2}$ which simply means that we select two
random bits from $\{0,1\}$.

$$
\begin{array}{ccc}
    \text{Alice} & {} & \text{Bob} \\
    \mathbb{F}_{2}^{2} \overset{\$}{\rightarrow} (a_{A}, b_{A}) & \space & \mathbb{F}_{2}^{2} \overset{\$}{\rightarrow} (a_{B}, b_{B})
\end{array}
$$

Next, Bob and Alice each generate random masking bits $r_{A}$ and 
$r_{B}$ respectively. 

$$
\begin{array}{ccc}
    \text{Alice} & {} & \text{Bob} \\
    \mathbb{F}_{2} \overset{\$}{\rightarrow} r_{A} & \space & \mathbb{F}_{2} \overset{\$}{\rightarrow} r_{B}
\end{array}
$$

### Step 2: Obtaining Shares of $c$

After generating the masking bits, Alice and Bob invoke an instance of $2 \choose 1$-OT$_2$ (see @sec-oblivious_transfer), where Alice acts as the sender with inputs $(r_{A}, r_{A} \oplus a_{A})$, and Bob acts as the receiver with input $b_B$. Bob obtains $b_{B}a_{A} \oplus r_{A}$.

Now, Alice and Bob invoke another instance of $2 \choose 1$-OT$_2$. This time, Bob serves as the sender with inputs $(r_{B}, r_{B} \oplus a_{B})$, and Alice serves as the receiver with input $b_A$. Consequently, Alice obtains $b_{A}a_{B} \oplus r_{B}$.

$$
\begin{array}{ccc}
    \text{Alice} & {} & \text{Bob} \\
    \text{Snd } = (r_{A}, r_{A}\oplus a_{A}) & \overset{{2 \choose 1}\text{-OT}_2}{\longrightarrow} & \text{Rcv } = b_{B}a_{A} \oplus r_{A} \\
    \text{Rcv } = b_{A}a_{B} \oplus r_{B} & \overset{{2 \choose 1}\text{-OT}_2}{\longleftarrow} & \text{Snd } = (r_{B}, r_{B} \oplus a_{B})
\end{array}
$$

Note that objective is for Alice and Bob to each hold shares of $c$, denoted as $c_A$ and $c_B$, respectively, such that their combination satisfies the equation $c = ab$. 

Alice had received $b_{A}a_{B} \oplus r_{B}$ from Bob, and she already has $b_{A}a_{A} \oplus r_{A}$. She computes $b_{A}a_{B} \oplus r_{B} \oplus b_{A}a_{A} \oplus r_{A}$, which simplifies to $b_{A}a \oplus r$. Alice sets $c_A = b_{A}a \oplus r$.

Similarly, Bob computes $b_{B}a_{A} \oplus r_{A} \oplus b_{B}a_{B} \oplus r_{B}$, which simplifies to $b_{B}a \oplus r$. Bob sets $c_B = b_{B}a \oplus r$.

$$
\begin{array}{ccc}
    \text{Alice} & & \text{Bob} \\
    c_A = b_{A}a \oplus r & \space & c_B = b_{B}a \oplus r
\end{array}
$$

It is easy to see that $c = c_A \oplus c_B = b_{A}a \oplus r \oplus b_{B}a \oplus r = ab$.

Thus, we have shown how Boolean Beaver's triples are randomly generated such that $c = c_A \oplus c_B$.
