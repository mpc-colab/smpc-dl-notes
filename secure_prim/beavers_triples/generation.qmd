## Generating Beaver's Triples

The first step in masking multiplications is to 
generate Beaver's Triples. These are random 
values $a, b, c$ such that $a \cdot b = c$

### Step 1: Generating Inputs

Suppose we have two parties, **Alice** and **Bob**. Here, we will 
suppose that Alice is the sender, and Bob is the receiver. All this 
really means is that Alice sends her values to Bob first, with Bob
sending his values to Alice thereafter. 

We begin by first generating a random pair $(a_{i}, b_{i})$ for each 
party where $i$ corresponds to the party in question. We generate 
these from the field $F_{2}^{2}$ which simply means that we select two
random bits from $\{0,1\}$

$$
\begin{array}{ccc}
    \text{Alice} & {} & \text{Bob} \\
    \mathbb{F}_{2}^{2} \overset{\$}{\rightarrow} (a_{A}, b_{A}) & \overbrace{}^{\&} & \mathbb{F}_{2}^{2} \overset{\$}{\rightarrow} (a_{B}, b_{B})
\end{array}
$$

Next, Bob and Alice each generate random masking values $r_{A}$ and 
$r_{B}$ respectively. 

$$
\begin{array}{ccc}
    \text{Alice} & {} & \text{Bob} \\
    \mathbb{F}_{2} \overset{\$}{\rightarrow} r_{A} & \space & \mathbb{F}_{2} \overset{\$}{\rightarrow} r_{B}
\end{array}
$$

### Step 2: Sending and Receiving Shares

After these masking values are generated, Alice uses
oblivious transfer (see @sec-oblivious_transfer) to send $(r_{A}, r_{A}\oplus a_{A})$ to Bob. 

When Bob receives this, he obtains $b_{B}a_{A} \oplus r_{A}$
and then sends $(r_{B}, r_{B} \oplus a_{B})$ to Alice

$$
\begin{array}{ccc}
    \text{Alice} & {} & \text{Bob} \\
    \text{Snd } = (r_{A}, r_{A}\oplus a_{A}) & \overset{OT}{\longrightarrow} & \text{Rcv } = b_{B}a_{A} \oplus r_{A} \\
    \text{Rcv } = b_{A}a_{B} \oplus r_{B} & \overset{OT}{\longleftarrow} & \text{Snd } = (r_{B}, r_{B} \oplus a_{B})
\end{array}
$$
