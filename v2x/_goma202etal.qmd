## Goma et.al on RLR Detection with SSD (Single Shot Detector)

> Work by @goma2022etal demonstrates the ability to detect
red-light-running and over-speeding with a high level of accuracy.
Specifically, they achieve **100%** accuracy on red light running 
detection and **92.1%** accuracy for over-speeding violations. 
They accomplish these results using a CNN applied to an SSD
(single deep neural network)
