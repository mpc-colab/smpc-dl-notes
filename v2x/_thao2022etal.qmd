## Thao et.al on Traffic Violation Detection

> The paper proposed by @thao2022etal introduces a mechanism
for detecting red light violations automatically. There paper is 
titled: 
*Automatic Traffic Red-Light Violation Detection Using AI*

### Problem Setting

The reason AI technologies (image classification and detection)
systems are better suited than standard sensor technologies is 
that they are able to operate more consistently, even when the
number of vehicles in the setting increases dramatically. 

### System Design and Solution Approach

Separate the task into three parts:

1. vehicle violation detection
2. red signal change monitoring
3. vehicle recognition

**Vehicle Violation Detection**

The <span style="color:LightGreen"> YOLOv5s pretrained model (COCO dataset) </span> 
is used for detecting violating
vehicles. After detecting violation, following frames are used
to try and determine the license plate (identfy vehicle). See @sec-yolo1 for 
more information on the YOLO object detection model.

Below, a picture of the overall system flow is presented:

* **vehicle tracking** - performed every 5 frames
  * if IOU (intersection over union) of bounding box is close to one 
    from a previous frame, then the car is assumed to be the same one
    from that frame.
* **violation line detection**
  * image processing is used to determine traffic lines
  * boundary lines are drawn onto frames captured by the camera later
* **traffic state detection**
  * color filters and image processing used to detect changes in the
    state of the traffic light

### Primary Contributions

1. Implementation of modified *YOLOv5s* model 
   1. used parameter changes from original model
   2. achieved following accuracy results:
      1. <span style="color:LightGreen"> 82% - vehicle identification </span>
      2. <span style="color:LightGreen"> 90% - traffic signal status change </span>
      3. <span style="color:LightGreen"> 86% - violation detection </span>
2. Best Performing Architecture given below (v3 / v4)
