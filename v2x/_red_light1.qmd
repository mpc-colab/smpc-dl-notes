## Motivation

Secure Red Light Violation detection is an important application
of secure machine learning protocols. 
Oftentimes, these systems will require the use of image segmentation
and object recognition protocols. The images used for this 
task expose often-times sensitive data about individual users. 

In the practical setting of interest, this means exposing license-plate
information, associated vehicles, and location information 
available from the images themselves.
