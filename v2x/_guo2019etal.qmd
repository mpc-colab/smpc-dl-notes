##  Attention Based Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks for Traffic Flow Forecasting

> In this paper, @guo2019etal proposed a method for traffic flow prediction
which utilized an **attention based spatial-temporal graph convolutional network**.
They aimed to model several time-dependencies: (1) recent, (2) daily-periodic, 
and (3) weekly-periodic dependencies. The *attention mechanism* captures 
spatial-temporal patterns in the traffic data and the *spatial-temporal convolution*
is used to capture spatial patterns while *standard convolutions* describe temporal
features.

Difficulties of the traffic forecasting problem

1. it is difficult to handle unstable and nonlinear data
2. prediction performance of models require extensive feature engineering
   1. domain expertise is necessary
3. cnn - spatial feature extraction from grid-based data, gcn - describe spatial
   correlation of grid based data
   1. fails to simultaneously model spatial temporal features and dynamic correlations
   of traffic data

Addressing these issues:

1. develop a *spatial-temporal attention mechanism* 
   1. learns dynamic spatial-temporal correlations of traffic data
   2. temporal attention is applied to capture dynamic temporal correlations
    for different times
2. Design of *spatial-temporal convolution module*
   1. has graph convolution for modeling graph structure
   2. has convolution in temporal dimension (kind of like 3-d convolution)
